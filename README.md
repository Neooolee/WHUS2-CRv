# WHUS2-CRv

This is a Sentinel-2A cloud removal dataset in which the paired cloud and cloud-free images are from different regions of the world. The types of land cover are rich and the acquisition dates of the experimental data cover a long time period (from 2015 to 2020) and all seasons.

The dataset can be found on: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8035347](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8035347).
